The is an update of the deep research solution from the end of week 2.  Updates:
- Focussed on research for an organisation with company and industry added in addition to query
- Introduction of a research manager agent to orchestrate and review / QA
- Planner, writer, search and email agents as tools
- Email agent using gmail rather than sendgrid
- Updates to UI layout

Potential future change is to incorporate sessions for user feedback.
