# Detailed Design for `accounts.py`

## Overview
This module is a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform as per the requirements provided. It allows for account creation, funds management, share trading, portfolio valuation, and transaction recording.

## Class and Method Layout

### Class: `Account`

#### Attributes:
- `username`: str - The account holder's username.
- `balance`: float - The current balance in the account.
- `initial_deposit`: float - The initial deposit made by the user.
- `holdings`: dict - A dictionary where keys are share symbols and values are quantities.
- `transactions`: list - A list of tuples containing transaction records.

#### Methods:

1. **`__init__(self, username: str, initial_deposit: float):`**
   - Initializes the account with the given username and initial deposit.
   - Sets up initial balance and holdings.
   - Records initial deposit transaction.

2. **`deposit(self, amount: float) -> bool:`**
   - Deposits the specified amount to the account balance.
   - Returns True if successful, False otherwise.

3. **`withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool:`**
   - Withdraws the specified amount from the account balance if sufficient funds are available.
   - Returns True if successful, False otherwise.

4. **`buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool:`**
   - Buys the specified quantity of shares of the given symbol if funds are sufficient.
   - Updates the holdings and transactions list.
   - Returns True if successful, False otherwise.

5. **`sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool:`**
   - Sells the specified quantity of shares of the given symbol if sufficient shares are available.
   - Updates the holdings and transactions list.
   - Returns True if successful, False otherwise.

6. **`calculate_portfolio_value(self) -> float:`**
   - Calculates and returns the total value of the user's portfolio.

7. **`calculate_profit_loss(self) -> float:`**
   - Calculates and returns the profit or loss from the initial deposit.

8. **`get_holdings(self) -> dict:`**
   - Returns the current holdings of shares.

9. **`get_transaction_history(self) -> list:`**
   - Returns the list of transactions performed by the user.

10. **`can_withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool:`**
    - Checks if it's possible to withdraw the specified amount without going negative.

11. **`can_buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool:`**
    - Checks if the user can afford to buy the specified quantity of shares of the given symbol.

12. **`can_sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool:`**
    - Checks if the user has enough shares to sell the specified quantity of shares.

### Function: `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float:`
- A placeholder function with fixed prices for test implementation.
- Returns current share price for AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL.

## Implementation Notes:
- `get_share_price` function could be injected or overridden in actual implementation scenarios.
- The design considers edge cases such as negative balance, insufficient shares, and affordability constraints.
- All monetary values are treated in float for precision.
- The transactions list ensures transparency and traceability for all operations.

This design is ready for implementation, testing, and extension for a simple UI interface.
