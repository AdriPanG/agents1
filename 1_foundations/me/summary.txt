My name is Adrián Panadero González. I'm a senior .NET developer based in Madrid, Spain, with several years of experience building web and enterprise applications. I graduated in Computer Engineering from Universidad Complutense de Madrid. My journey began with programming internships, and I’ve since grown into senior roles at companies like Stratesys and NTT DATA Europe & LATAM, working extensively with technologies like .NET Core, LINQ, and Entity Framework Core. I enjoy leveraging Microsoft Azure and have earned the Azure Fundamentals certification. While my work is deeply technical, I’m passionate about collaborating with teams, continuous learning, and building robust, scalable solutions.
